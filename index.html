        <p>Hi, I'm Prince Ive Eriabie, a passionate learner with a deep love for technology and problem-solving. 
            Growing up in Benin, I discovered my interest in computers, which led me to pursue a degree in Industrial Mathematics at the University of Benin. Despite the early loss of both my parents, I've been fortunate to have the support of my family,
             which has kept me focused and driven. Now, I'm pursuing a degree in Software Development at BYU Pathway, combining my technical skills and passion for education to advance my career in tech.
            I've gained practical experience in web development, customer support, and leadership through internships and my two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
            These experiences have helped me develop strong problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and a commitment to making an impact.
             I'm excited to continue learning and growing as I work toward my goal of becoming a proficient software developer who creates meaningful solutions.</p>
