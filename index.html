            <p>Hi, I'm Prince Ive Eriabie, and I've always had a deep passion for learning, technology, 
            and problem-solving. Growing up in Benin, I developed a love for computers that led me to 
            study Industrial Mathematics at the University of Benin. Despite losing both my parents at a young age,
            I've been blessed with the support of my family, and it has kept me going.
            Now, I'm pursuing a Software Development degree at BYU Pathway to combine
            my love for tech and education and take my skills to the next level.</p>
